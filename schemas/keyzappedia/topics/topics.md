# Topics
"Topics" are Big Ticket items in Keyzappedia that have their own pages.  They conform to a standard interface, exposing a set of common fields.

## Topics Interface
Note the topics interface is not a Typescript Interface and is not defined or enforced in any way.

Topics must have:
* Title (field name: "title")
* Internal Description or Summary (field: "internalDescription")
* ...More? Documentation incomplete!!  

In the Keyzappedia UI, a topic should have its own page template.
